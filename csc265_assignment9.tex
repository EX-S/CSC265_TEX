\begin{comment}
	A list of the vertices of a graph is the order they are visited during a
	breadth first search is called a breadth first search order of the graph.
	Similarly, a depth first search order of a graph is a list of the vertices
	of a graph in the order they are visited during a depth first search. 
	Note that the breadth first search order and depth first search order of a
	graph can depend on the order in which the children oeach node are
	enumerated.

	For any (directed or undirected) graph $G=(V,E)$, its squeare $G^2=(V,E^2)$
	is the graph with the same vertex set $V$ and with edge set consisting of
	all pairs of vertices that are distance one or two apart in $G$. 
	In other $G^2$ can be obtained from $G$ by adding new edges joining all
	pairs of vertices that are distance two apart in $G$.
