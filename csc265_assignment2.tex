\begin{enumerate}

	\item We will start the proof by proving some lemmas. 
	\textbf{Lemma 1:} A subtree of an R-tree is also an R-tree.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $S$ be any subtree of an R-tree $T$. \\
		\texit{Case 1:} $S$ is empty.
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			This is trivial, since an empty can also be an R-tree.
		\end{addmargin}
		\textit{Case 2:} $S$ has only 1 node.
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			The only node is the root of the subtree $S$. \\
			Let the node be $x$. \\
			By properties of R-tree, the weight of $x$ must be a positive
			integer. \\
			Since $S$ is a subtree of $T$, $x$ is the a leaf in $T$. \\
			Then $x$ must have a positive integer weight. \\
			Since there existes only one path in $S$, the third property will
			always be satisfied. \\
			Therefore, $S$ is an R-tree.
		\end{addmargin}
		\textit{Case 3:} $S$ has more than 1 node. \\
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			Since $S$ is a subtree of $T$, all internal nodes in $S$ are
			internal nodes in $T$, and all leaves in $S$ are leaves in $T$. \\
			Then the first and second properties of R-tree are automatically
			satisfied. \\
			Let $x$ be the root of $S$. \\
			Since any path from the root to a leaf in $T$ have the same weight,
			all paths from the root to a leaf through $x$ have the same weight
			as well. \\
			Let the weight be $w$. \\
			There is only one path from the root of $T$ to $x$. \\
			Let the weight of this path be $w'$. \\
			Suppose $x$ has a weight of $w''$. \\
			Then, any path from $x$ to a leaf will have the weight of
			$w-w'+w''$. \\
			That is, the third property is also satisfied. \\
			Hence, $S$ is an R-tree.
		\end{addmargin}
		From all these cases, we can conclude that $S$ is an R-tree. \\
		By generalization, a subtree of an R-tree is an R-tree. 
	\end{proof}

	\texbf{Lemma 2:} Suppose there is an R-tree $T$ with a subtree $S$. Let
		$S'$ be an R-tree such that the weight of all path from the root to a
		leaf have the same weight as in $S$. Replace $S$ by $S'$ and obtain a
		new tree $T'$. Then $T'$ is an R-tree. 
	\begin{proof}
		%TODO
	\end{proof}

	\textbf{INSERT}
	\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
		\textit{Case 1:} Inserting to an empty tree.
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			Simply add a root to the tree and make the key equal to the element to be inserted, also, weight it 1. \\
			There is no non-leaf node in the tree. \\
			The root is a leaf and it has a positve integer weight. \\
			There is only one path from the root to a leaf (the root), so the sum of the weights of the nodes on any path is the same.
			Therefore, it is a R-tree.
		\end{addmargin}
		\textit{Case 2:} Inserting into an arbitrary non-empty R-tree.
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			Suppose the insertion is performed on a leaf $x$, weighted $w$. \\
			By the properties of R-tree, $w$ is a positive integer. \\
			The insertion give both new leaves weight 1, and thus, the property "each leaf has a positive integer weight" is satisfied. \\
			The new internal node is weighted $w-1$. \\
			$w-1$ is non-negative, since $w$ is a positive integer. \\
			Then, in the new tree, each non-leaf node has a non-integer weight. \\
			Also, each path in the subtree has a weight of $w$, which implies that the two new paths have the same weights as the path from root to $x$ on the original tree.
			Therefore, all path from the root to a leaf have the same weight.
			Hence, the new tree is a R-tree, since all three properties are satisfied.
		\end{addmargin}

		In conclusion, if an insertion is applied on a R-tree, the result is a R-tree.
	\end{addmargin}

	\textbf{DELETE}
	\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
		\textit{Case 1:} Deleting from a R-tree with one node.
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			Simply delete the root of the tree and it becomes am empty R-tree.
		\end{addmargin}
		\textit{Case 2:} Deleting from a R-tree with more than one node.
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
			Since R-tree is leaf-oriented, a deletion will always be performed on a leaf. \\
			Suppose the leaf to be performed on is $x$ with weight $w'$. \\
			Since the R-tree has more than one node, which means that $x$ must have a parent. \\
			Let the parent be $p$ with weight $w$. \\
			Since $p$ is a non-leaf node, it has two children. \\
			That is, $x$ has a sibling $y$. \\
			Let $w''$ be the weight of $y$. \\
			Each path from a leaf upto $p$ has a weight of $w+w'$. \\
			Then, $w' \geq w''$. \\
			$y$ might be a leaf or an internal node. \\
			Either case, all other leaves except $x$ will remain the same after the deletion, and thus, their weights are all positive. \\
			$x$ is a leaf, so $w'$ is positive, and $w+w'$ will also be postive. \\
			Thus, the weight of $y$ will always be a positive integer. \\
			Therefore, all leaves have positive weights.
			Similarly, all other internal nodes except $p$ remain the same after the deletion. \\
			Then, all non-leaf node have non-negative weight.\\
			Since any path from $p$ to a leaf has a weight of $w+w'$, any path from $y$ to a leaf has a weight of $w'$. \\
			Consider the new tree after deletion. \\
			$x$ and $p$ are removed and $y$ replaced $p$. \\
			The path from $y$ to a leaf of the subtree all have the same weight of $w+w''+w'-w'' = w+w'$, which is the same as the weigh from $p$ to a leaf on the original tree. \\
			Hence, all path from a leaf to the root has the same weight.
		\end{addmargin}
		Therefore, if an deletion rule is applied to an R-tree, the result is an R-tree.	
	\end{addmargin}

	\textbf{REBALANCING}
	\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
		\textit{Rule 1:}
		\begin{addmargin}
			The initial R-tree have a root which is not a leaf. \\
			Changing the weight on the root won't affect the weight of any leaf
			or any other internal node. \\
			Also, 1 is a positive integer. \\
			So, the first two properties of an R-tree is satisfied. \\
			Since the weight of all path from the root to a leaf will always
			include the weight of the root, modifying the weight of the root
			wont affect the third property of an R-tree. \\
			Therefore, all properties are satisfied, and thus, the new tree is
			also an R-tree. \\
		\end{addmargin}
		\textit{Rule 2:}
		\begin{addmargin}
			Consider the subtree $t$ where $x$ is the root. \\
			$x$ is an internal node, since it has two children. \\
			Since $w \geq 1$, $w-1 \geq 0$ which is legal for an internal node.\\
			Also 1 is a totally legal weight for any node. \\
			Let $u$ and $v$ be the children of $x$, and let $c$ be the child of
			$u$ with a weight of 0. \\
			Let weight for any path from $x$ to a leaf be $w+k$, where $k$ is
			some positive integer. \\
			Then all path for the new subtree will have a weight of $w-1 + 1 +
			(w+k) - w = w+k$, which is the same as the initial subtree. \\
			Therefore, the new tree is an R-tree after applying rule 2.
