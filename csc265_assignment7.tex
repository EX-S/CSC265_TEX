	Consider the DISJOINT SET data sturcture that represents each set by a tree, 
	preform LINK(x, y) by making y a child of x, and use path compression during FIND-SET.

	For any node x, let w(x) denote the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at x.

	Prove that, if n MAKE-SET operations and any number of LINK and FIND-SET operations have 
	been performed, then any node has at most $\log_2(n)$ ancestor v, such that $w(parent(v)) \geq 2w(v)$.

	Using the accounting method, prove that the amartized complexity of MAKE-SET is $O(1)$ and the amartized
	complexity of LINK and FIND-SET are $O(\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of MAKE-SET operations performed.

	Consider the following credit invariant: Each node $x$ has $\log_2(w(x))$ credits associated with it.

	Using the potential method, prove that the amartized complexity of MAKE-SET is $O(1)$
	and the amartized complexity of LINK and FIND-SET are $O(\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of
	MAKE-SET operations that have been performed.
