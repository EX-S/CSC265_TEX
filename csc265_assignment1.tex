	The idea of my algorithm is is basically a BFS on this binary tree B that starts from the root and go down 1 level per iteration. If the current node is nil then stop searching down. If the current node is smaller than the number $x$, then add 1 to the counter, which keeps track of the number of nodes which are larger then $x$, and add its left child and right child to a list of nodes for the next iteration. If the counter exceeds $k$, then return true. If there is no nodes to be performed on the next iteration and the counter does not exceed $k$, return false. Otherwise, keep iterating.

	The algorithm should return True if the $k$'th largest number in the tree is greater than $x$ and False otherwise. 
   
 Suppose there are at least $k$ numbers larger than $x$ in B, then the $k$'th largest number is larger than $x$.
Conversely, if the $k$'th largest number in B is large than $x$, then there at least exists $k$ numbers larger than $x$ in B is also true. 
Thus, base on the propostion above, if we find $k$ numbers which are larger than $x$ ,then it is sufficient to return True, and if we find that there can't be $k$ numbers larger than $x$, then it is sufficient to conclude that the $k$'th largest number is no larger than $x$.

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
    \textbf{Proposition:} The $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x
    \iff$ there at least exists $k$ numbers larger than $x$ in B.
    
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose the $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x$.
        \begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
            Then, the 1st to the $k-1$'th largest numbers are all greater than
            the $k$'th largest number in B, which are all greater than $x$.
            Thus, there at least exists $k$ numbers greater than $x$ in B.
        \end{addmargin}
        Therefore, the $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x \iimplies$
        there at least exists $k$ number larger than $x$ in B.

        Suppose the $k$'th largest number in B is no greater than $x$.
        \begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
            Then, the $k+1$'th... are all no larger than $x$.
            Thus, there are at most $k-1$ numbers greater than $x$.
        \end{addmargin}
        Therefore, the $k$'th largest number in B is no greater than $x
        \iimplies$ there does not exist $k$ numbers larger than $x$ in B.
        By contrapositive, there at least exists $k$ numbers larger than $x$ in
        B $\iimplies$ the $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x$.

        Above all, The $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x \iff$ there
        at least exists $k$ numbers larger than $x$ in B.
    \end{proof}
\end{addmargin}

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
    \textbf{Lemma 1:} Let $P={n_1,n_2, \cdots}$ be the multiset of all nodes
    enqueued by the algorithm performed on $B$, $k$ and $x$, then $P$ is a set.
    \begin{proof}
        B is a BST.
        By the properties of BST, there exists a unique path for each node from
        the root, since each node could only have 1 parent.
        %TODO
    \end{proof}
\end{addmargin}


    Let B be an arbitrary BST that satisfy the properties, and let $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. 
\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
  Suppose the Algorithm returns True.
By the if statement from line 14 to 18, $i \geq k$ after the while loop on line 6-13 halts.
Before the while loop is performed, $i$ is initialized as 1 by line 2.
Line 11 is the only excutation that could increment i, in which case, it must be performed for at least k times so that i exceeds k.
Since line 11 belongs to the if statement from line 8 to 12, there are at least $k$ nodes which have the numbers larger than $x$ by Lemma 1.
%TODO: Lemma 1
Thus, by the proposition stated above, the $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x$.
\end{addmargin}

Therefore, the Algotithem returns True $\iimplies$ the $k$'th largest number in B is larger than $x$. 

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
  Suppose the algorithm returns False.
Then, by the if statement from line 14 to line 18, $i < k$ after the while loop.
By the conditions on line 6, the while loop halts when $i \geq k \oor$  \textbf{EMPTY}($Q$) is True.
Since, $i < k$, $Q$ is empty after the last iteration of the while loop.
